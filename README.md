# Library Management System

## Description:
The Advanced Library Management System project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience in various areas of software development, including object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, database design, SQL skills, and JDBC utilization. Participants will build a sophisticated library management system that incorporates these concepts to efficiently manage library resources and operations. JavaFX will be utilized to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the library management system, providing features such as forms for data input, tables for displaying information, and buttons for executing actions.
# Implementation Details:
## Object-Oriented Programming:
Define classes for books, patrons, transactions, and other relevant entities with appropriate attributes and methods.
Implement inheritance hierarchy to represent different types of library resources.
Utilize polymorphism to support various library operations and behaviors.
## Data Structures Implementation:
Implement linked lists for managing book lists and patron records efficiently.
Utilize stacks and queues for transaction management, book reservations, and lending processes.
## Database Design and SQL Skills:
Design the library database schema using a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Normalize the database schema to third normal form (3NF) to minimize data redundancy and ensure data consistency.
Write SQL queries for creating database tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and querying information.
## JDBC Utilization:
Establish a JDBC connection to the library database and manage database connections efficiently.
Use JDBC to execute SQL statements, including prepared statements and callable statements.
Implement error handling and exception management strategies to ensure robustness and reliability.
